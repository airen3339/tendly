/**
 * Items that arrive faster than a screen can show them -- a reply streams
 * dozens of pieces a second -- applied together once per frame, so the view
 * is rebuilt and re-rendered once per frame rather than once per piece.
 * `flush` applies what is waiting at once, for an arrival that must not be
 * reordered behind the queue (a snapshot replaces what the queue builds on).
 *
 * With `leading`, the first item after a quiet spell is applied at once and
 * only what follows it waits for a frame. A terminal echoing a keystroke uses
 * this: the echo shows without a frame's delay, and a burst of output behind
 * it is still gathered. The window stays open while items keep arriving and
 * closes on the first frame that finds nothing waiting.
